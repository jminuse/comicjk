The low-temperature Rankine cycle is for adding insult to injury.
Designing airplanes became a lot easier once we replaced the sky with maple syrup.
And Voyager adjusts the orbit of the sun through the galaxy.
Or perhaps nobody wanted to tell Hooke his idea was dumb, so we just ran with it.
I used to have a machine that would do jobs like this; I called it a 'computer'
It's as if people told you to use a camera because paintbrushes were too complicated.
Experiment: of the people most vocally opposed to judging people by their clothes, how many will make negative assumptions if they see you wearing a suit?
I guess this means in a week you should all buy Men's Wearhouse.
I don't mind as long as I'm not in season.
Instead of slapstick, you use punchcards.
At least it will save me from making up twenty furious hover texts.
&quot;If it fails you can publish a paper on how bubble gum is not effective. Or whatever I said earlier.&quot;
Did you know x>>0 can be much faster than Math.floor(x)? The rabbit hole goes deep.
'xor A A' is faster than 'A = 0.' Of course the difference is trivial - or as we say in assembly language, 'mandatory.'
This song works on many levels, but it's mostly about renewable energy.
Note: this proof is invalid if the simulator doesn't implement Grand Unified Theory.
I like how English has no bounded length for sentences.
That's one small step for man, one giant concentration of carbon monoxide.
A cruel irony in the nature of knowledge itself? That just proves that my view of the world is right!
Political arms race: every country elects crazy people, in an attempt to intimidate the lunatics in charge elsewhere.
I especially like it when they acknowledge their debts to their spouses and children.
Sufficiently advancing caching is indistinguishable from ansibles.
A feature that was most necessary in HTML 2, so naturally it was added in HTML 5.
You're going to look pretty silly if there isn't one. Or I guess...not.
And yet this is more understanding than 90% of people will ever have.
It might be worth it if we can find a rich pocket of gold on the moon, but please don't extend that into the marital metaphor.
It's no contest - a douche is at least clean.
Those natives who sold Manhattan for $24 must be pissed. If they had written Facebook, they could buy it back.
My app uses 'progressive enhancement' to improve the experience in more advanced browsers. The baseline experience is a message saying 'requires Javascript.'
Maybe fictional works can't build on each other the way inventions do. Then again, they did in the Middle Ages, and now it's illegal.
Deeds of bad writing done, between the 'Action!' and the opening run, in cinema lie like bones, each one.
I think they're afraid that if we reviewed the situations in which we grant monopolies independently, we might come to very different conclusions.
I spent a good part of last week trying to design a system that was completely proof against man-in-the-middle attacks. It's like that time I tried to find the exact value of pi.
Don't look up...it's in your address bar RIGHT NOW.
Cryptography becomes harder when the man in the middle is also a wizard.
Combining the convection and diffusion equations resulted in the Star Wars prequels.
There are a lot of dams, so the main point stands. Unless you're a stickler about 36 not being equal to 1.
Peer review = trying to find software bugs by looking at an edited selection of outputs and none of the code.
For those of you not living in the US, let me clue you in: we have a $2 billion industry dedicated to us not getting objective information about politics.
Real scientists must replenish their wisdom by going in the lab every three days. Or maybe it's just the Kandrona rays.
And it will be true right away if we just believe hard enough.
The divine plan specifies 99.999% uptime, but it's hazy on enforcement.
You would think Americans could trust each other, now that the bad 1% of us are in prison.
I believe in the separation of him and state.
He almost convinced the thesis committee that it only looked like nonsense because it was so effective. Meanwhile, a dozen philosophers graduated via the same tactic.
Actually...health care costs so much in the US that the baby boomers may take the country with them.
It's not just an echo server - it has ads, too.
Apparently some people are calmer thinking that every competitor is dead.
For one thing, we'll run out of space to put everything. If only there were some space with enough space to give us plenty of space...
With a print statement. Or in Python 3, print with parentheses for some idiotic reason.
It's hard to defend representative democracy when people, of their own volition, choose to be represented by their high school bullies.
I seem to have drawn the speculator-rage signal slightly leading the price signal, so you could make money in oil trading just by keeping an eye on reddit.
This is going to be a fun century, I just know it.
But the change aversion is worse in the other direction - thus, gene simulations in Matlab.
Hey, it's about as effective as using cleric spells for damage.
We live in interesting times. Which times exactly? Hold on, let me get my phone.
If you haven't heard of these things, consider this a window into my madness.
Grant proposals are like neutrons. You spit out one, with any luck it spawns two more, and eventually this process destroys the world.
I hear - this is not a joke - that Google is shifting away from Python for internal development, towards Java. Sell, sell, sell.
Unique among the quantum states in that it always collapses to the same observable outcome.
And C++ is like boiling-water reactors. Needless to say, it sucks.
I was an early adopter of Vista, and it spawned a 30-strip story arc on how Microsoft was murdering people with a dojo of evil cyborg ninjas. Someone else can take this one.
Let's face it, it's time for us to stop using these. You're not stupid.
I would joke that future people will follow the &quot;21st Century Diet,&quot; but they're more likely to view it the way we do human sacrifice.
Thanks to a server outage, this news is somewhat dated.
In the process of restoring the server, I lost FTP access for a week. Having enjoyed this lazy period, I'm downgrading from 5 comics/week to 3 (xkcd schedule). As usual, discuss cogently below -- JK.
Some will say this violates Occam's Razor, but they're just confused from spinning in so many tiny circles.
Fus roh dah works best for large values of &#961;.
Jon's Law of Engines: &quot;Any interesting space drive is a weapon of mass destruction. It only matters how long you want to wait for maximum damage.&quot;
C is like the reptilian hindbrain of the programmer: it's extremely inconvenient, except that it's the thing keeping us alive.
They drilled too greedily and too deep, without proper wastewater treatment facilities.
And there's no question Congress contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp. Or at least all of the adjectives apply.
If we ever do extend human lifespan indefinitely, this may become a problem.
If we had fusion power tomorrow, it would just be another source of high-capital, low-fuel-cost renewable power. In fact, the only big benefit is for spaceships...I mean, it will solve everything! Government funding please!
They're both wrong - if you want to relax, join the ComicJK subreddit by clicking the Forum button at the bottom left of the comic.
Unless that house has a quarter-acre of ground-source heat pumps in the backyard.
If thinking gibberish is funny when typeset like a math journal is wrong, I don't want to be right. I do, however, want to be published.
Required classes make you learn things that have a high activation energy, but turn out to be a favored state. Or at least that's what I've said ever since high school chemistry (thanks, Ms Basker).
It's like when Goldilocks ate dirt and fell asleep on the floor.
At the very least, more energy than we'll ever get cleanly from coal.
That's why they call it the Republican party.
Also because the bottom graduate, in any subject, is probably a bad conversationalist as well as hard to employ.
This is not the usual tactic - it's much cheaper to hire lobbyists.
Foolish Asimov, he thought that proof would actually change something.
And being a states' rights issue is not a good long-term strategy. Just look at slavery.
The cheapest way to secure your laptop, then, is to make a blog post telling everyone about ridiculous security measures like a USB pass - wait a minute, I don't think I'm the first person to figure this out.
Better than the Call of the Python, when I black out and wake up with no curly braces in any of my C or Java.
&quot;People don't know what a mass balance is, so I'll just put you down for the last three words.&quot;
I'm sure we'll adapt.
But this increases the risk of a presidential wedgie.
Facebook has a high-growth valuation and no room to grow, Google+ has plenty of room to grow since it's not worth anything.
Overproduction has long made that business uneconomical.
Adding an extra term to the Drake Equation, we can calculate that such a section probably does not exist.
I think they have a pretty good shot, depending on whether this takes place before or after 1991.
45 points is a big difference - each way.
OCD probably fits in there too. And whatever they call 'the need to have your mental disorder portrayed as a quirky side effect of your intelligence.'
A tiny input of legitimacy produces a huge excess of uninformed people's trust. I thought I might come up with a cool name for this principle, but then I remembered - we call them con artists.
And their Javascript files got so big and slow, they had to build an incredibly fast web browser so we wouldn't notice.
It would also make a lot of games and novels set in Orion look really silly.
I'm still a big fan of his triangle.
Also I still hold a little hope for a theory which has FTL without breaking causality.
I hope he has better other people than the other guy.
