Your mother is almost as boring as the following discussion:

first i don&#039;t get it
&gt; Neither do I, actually.
&gt;&gt;You must be American...
&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#039;m Czech and I don&#039;t get it. Why would I have to be American not to get it?!

The verb form of prophesy is spelled prophesy, with an S.
That said, I didn&#039;t get the comic either, though the alt-text was good.

English parliamentary elections... it was more or less a tie so there are two people working as prime ministers.
&gt; Hey! I&#039;m still a king, too! Look! I&#039;ve got the shiny hat and everything!
&gt;....I just like to share, that&#039;s all.
&gt;&gt; LOLness is LOL

It&#039;s about the hung parliament in the UK.
&gt;You&#039;ve gotta love our defunct political system
&gt;&gt;people said they wanted an end to hidden deal-making in politics... so they voted for a hung parliament... ( oh the painful irony )
&gt;&gt;&gt;New Zealand had one of those in the early 1990s. Three months went by before it was resolved. Three months without a government. Nobody noticed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I voted for the hung parliament intentionally.  The idea was to end up with a government that was too busy arguing with itself to screw up the country...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it&#039;s more likely that voting for an inconclusive result will produce an outcome that no-one actually wants, but all are stuck with... ( &quot;painting the wall yellow&quot; as it were... )
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You cant vote for a hung parlement, you vote for one of the parties.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;well actually, one can vote *for* a hung parliament... by voting for a specific party - not because one supports that party, but because one is aming for a specific result in that constituency ( whether the aim is to retain or dislodge the incumbent ) - and hoping that enough people do the same in enough constituencies... In the UK, the practice used to be called &quot;tactical voting&quot; and at every election for almost 20 years, certain politicians and pundits have encouraged voters to vote &quot;tactically&quot;, with the specific intention of causing a hung parliament, thus granting influence to the smaller parties...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Exactly.  I implemented tactical voting to bring about a hung parliament.

People were fed up with Labour, but many didn&#039;t trust the Conservatives.  So a lot voted for Liberal Democrats.  The Conservatives were the largest party, but didn&#039;t have an overall majority; Labour didn&#039;t have enough MPs to form a government, even with the Liberal Democrats, but the Conservatives did, so we now have a Conservative - Liberal Democrat coalition.  So far it looks remarkably stable.  Many people think it&#039;s good, as the two parties have agreed a set of policies that leave out the extremes; others are upset because they&#039;d expected the Liberal Democrats to support Labour.  Cameron (C) is Prime Minister; Clegg (LD) is Deputy Prime Minister.
