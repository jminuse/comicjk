&gt;shit not given 

What are you doing to stop children suffering?
&gt;I changed my Facebook profile picture.
&gt;&gt;Not having children and humanely killing all the ones that seem to be suffering
&gt;&gt;&gt;Seems good to me! Seems a much more worthy crusade than most people nowadays.

The good old &quot;TotC&quot; argument - works on everyone.

Nice to see atheists and those who believe in god have something in common.
&gt;You could make a two axis plot of it: reason/feelings vs atheism/theism. It would be a lot like that diamond graph libertarians like.
&gt;&gt;As Terry Pratchett writes, gods don&#039;t hate atheists; they even like them: Their belief in Gods&#039; non-existence is just as good as the belief of theists.
&gt;&gt;&gt;diction fail.
&gt;&gt;&gt;It&#039;s hard to be an atheist when the gods come round in the evenings to heave bricks through your windows.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if they were actually gods, they wouldn&#039;t have to *come around*, let alone actually *heave*...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tell that to Thor.

&gt;I&#039;m reminded of that Iain M. Banks novel, with the gas-giant Dwellers. They live for billions of years, and they spend the first few centuries of their lives being hunted for sport by their elders.
&gt;We should do that!
&gt;&gt;We already do!
&gt;&gt;&gt;The Algebraeist? I love that book. Though the old man turning into a walrus bemused me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That&#039;s the one. I also just remembered the Dweller captain who kept a couple of Dweller fetuses as pets.

But why can&#039;t a god unworthy the name exist?
&gt; Define &quot;god&quot; and &quot;unworthy&quot; first. If by &quot;god&quot; you mean an omnipotent omniscient creator, then because that&#039;s a fairy tale and makes no sense, regardless of how bloodthirsty you do or don&#039;t paint him/her/it/them. And if by &quot;unworthy&quot; you mean &quot;failing to live up to my human expectations&quot;, aren&#039;t you classifying your moral judgement as better than god&#039;s? Either way (both ways), god&#039;s in trouble...
&gt;&gt; I&#039;ll be happy with &quot;god&quot; meaning an enormously powerful sentient entity that wilfully brought about our existence, and &quot;unworthy&quot; to mean that it doesn&#039;t match our expectations, sure. Why shouldn&#039;t such an entity be possible?

Should have ready those terms of use before you agreed to it, eh?
&gt;No-one has time to read all that boring legalese about who begat whom.

Finite suffering x theoretically infinite lives = infinite suffering
&gt;That would be reincarnation - a good summary of why people who believe in reincarnation don&#039;t want infinite lives. 
&gt;&gt;Which is why mostly we prefer the afterlife theory, where we get 1 life and then an existence of pure happiness.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you should take a look at the population of respective religions on a global scale before making such bold sweeping statements.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Monotheistic and atheistic religions have greater populations than polytheistic religions at the current time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Atheistic religion? How does that work?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A belief system that doesn&#039;t involve a god.  Maybe Buddhism?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;why couldn&#039;t we take the cat approach of nine lives and the sum of all of them determines your final afterlife. Just in case you ended up in a really really screwed up body that had a genetic predisposition to anger.
