You missed one, just before &quot;Become Famous.&quot;  Red:  Live in comfort;  Blue:  Family starves.  

We know that Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are going to Hell.
&gt;You can&#039;t say you didn&#039;t suspect
&gt;&gt;though I&#039;m not a fan of either man per se, one does have to question the sense of perspective that makes people jump to naming those two as someone &quot;going to Hell&quot;, rather than a dictator or serial killer or some such...
&gt;&gt;&gt;don&#039;t worry, the latter mentioned dictators and serial killers aren&#039;t off the hook, just not mentioned here as their work doesn&#039;t really apply...just saying.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Who&#039;s to say that they&#039;re not secretly dictators or serial killers?

One problem - can corporate researchers be blamed for the fallacies of capitalism?  The only way you can recoup your research expenses is to patent the result and sell it.  Grant-funded research is a brilliant thing, but it&#039;s severely limited - anything that requires a lot of money - pharmaceuticals, robotics - can&#039;t be developed in the financially limited environment of academic research.  Is corporate research ideal?  Hell no, but capitalism won, communism lost, and, within the confines of a capitalist society, that&#039;s how expensive research gets done.  That said, there&#039;s a drug that treats an illness about 20 people in Canada have - treatment costs about half a million a year, because less than 1 in a million people have the illness and the research royalties are borne by the consumer.  Clearly a broken system.
&gt;&gt;Im sorry, but how is this a broken system? 
&gt;tl;dr,
&gt;The company could always cut their losses and license the patent. The problem with the patent system isn&#039;t so much the &quot;get royalty payments&quot; part, but the &quot;keep your work safe from others&quot; part, which implies &quot;keep your work safe from others, never do anything with it, and litigate the hell out of anyone that tries&quot;.
&gt;&gt;For 20 some odd years. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Usually it&#039;s more &quot;keep your work safe from others because you want to recover development costs so you can develop the next, better version&quot; - if you make it public domain right away, everyone else can just manufacture it at a fraction the cost (hence name brand pharmaceuticals are so much more expensive than their competition).  The &quot;do nothing with it and litigate like mad&quot; part comes from a combination of &quot;I thought this was useful and I don&#039;t remember why&quot; and &quot;I have lawyers on retainer and they get bored when I don&#039;t give them stuff to do.&quot;  I do have to agree that the 20 year latency on publicizing inventions is extreme, though, especially for things like US 5255452 (An example used in my ethics/law class during my engineering degree - a patent on a &quot;Method and means for creating an anti-gravity illusion&quot;)  The lag time also delays progress, since you often can&#039;t improve on a technology without being allowed to make it and tinker.  
&gt; Why is academic research financially limited?
&gt;&gt; Because money is valuable.  People only invest large sums of money in things they think they can get a profit in.  Academic research does not directly produce an income, and thus does not make a good investment.  Hence my earlier statement that capitalism is flawed - success comes from being a selfish bastard.
&gt;If only scientists are half as good as Jehovah&#039;s witness or Scientology, we can manipulate people into funding scientific research. Surely, scientists will be able to research eternal life some day, and it&#039;s only for those people who wait ;)

For sure more engineers in hell than physicists.  More chemists than archaeologists, more meteorologists than volcanologists, and definitely more biogeneticists than botanists. Geologists are split 50/50. Aside: Which professions are more likely to even believe in hell in the first place? Ans: engineers 
^^The above is only my personal opinion as a Physics major and high school physics teacher who can barely pay the bills. If I only would have sold my soul for a higher paying profession----like engineering. There still is time. Mephistopholes are you there?^^ (In all of this I am trying to be funny people!)
^^Not as concerned enough about &quot;true science&quot; to see the light (or hide from it)
&gt;&gt;&gt;and are these &quot;engineers&quot;, as defined by recognised qualification and/or professional certification... ? or people who call themselves &quot;engineers&quot; because they tinker with some machine occasionally... ? ( e.g.: in some locations, the sales droids sent round to fit satellite TV systems get labelled as &quot;engineers&quot;... )
^^engineering majors or physics majors who are qualified professionals.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hate to burst your bubble, mate, but the only difference between a scientist and an engineer is that engineers use existing science and scientists work on developing new stuff (for us to use)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And better paychecks.
&gt;Engineers always were more practical. 
&gt;&gt;for some reason, this reminds me of an old Rowan Atkinson sketch in which he plays the Devil - &quot;but you can call me Toby&quot; - welcoming new entrants to Hell... I won&#039;t give away the punchline: the sketch should be watched, not described...

Patents should be reserve-able only by people that are actually trying to make the patented object.
&gt;That is indeed the spirit of patent law.  Lawyers eat spirits for breakfast, however, so that&#039;s not how it actually works.
&gt;&gt;And the rest of us drink spirits with lunch.

y so socialist?
&gt;y so blind?
&gt;&gt;y use y instead of why? every time you use letters in places of words, Al Qaeda wins!

I just swallowed my gum.
