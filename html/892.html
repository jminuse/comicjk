Enter your thoughts on number 892 here. Please, no spamming, trolling, cussing, your mom jokes, or phasing out watches already.

The easiest way to spot a moron is to ask them the time - if they pull out a &#039;phone despite wearing a watch, they&#039;re a moron.
&gt; Or they started wearing the watch yesterday.

I wear mechanical watches... &quot;sweeping&quot; second hand is so much more badass than a cellphone...

So, that &quot;your lifetime&quot; bar... Are you saying that we&#039;re all going to die? Is this some &quot;mayan 2012&quot; thing?
&gt; The rounded corners tell me that every reader of this comic was born within the same, say, 2-year period. Same for death. Now that&#039;s a niche market!
&gt;&gt; small market, more probably
&gt; Cryonics FTW!

*looks at his mechanical watch* :-P
&gt; Whippersnappers with their fancy electronic gizmos. *grumbles*

You think this is bad, look at the graph for PAPER. 
&gt; That&#039;s an interesting point, let me print it out...

You missed 1988: &quot;Huge clock-watches worn around the neck&quot;
&gt;YEAH BOYEE!

FYI phones still have quartz timers in them.
&gt;They are still mass produced, too!

Watches aren&#039;t being &quot;phased out&quot; just because they&#039;re being integrated in watchphonecameragendacomputers: in 20 years they&#039;ll be the same size of a current watch, so we&#039;ll probably be wearing them around the wrist. Clorcke&#039;s third law: any sufficiently advanced computer is indistinguishable (at first glance) from a 1960&#039;s electric watch.
&gt; I donno.. with the advent of touch screens, high pixel density displays, and uses like gaming and reading books, it seems phones are getting bigger, not smaller.
&gt;&gt;It will be interesting to see where sizes converge among watches, phones, tablets, desktops, televisions.
&gt;&gt;&gt;There&#039;s a funny thing there. You can bet that magazines, comics and MAYBE newspapers will still be around for a long long time. Internet took a huge chunk of their market, but printed media can still offer something that Internet can&#039;t. Television, on the other hand, cannot. So it&#039;s going away, rather soon I think.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Television will disappear when the Baby Boomers are gone. Until then I&#039;m afraid we are stuck with it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Television, but not televisions.  Or maybe televisions too?  Maybe the line between televisions and desktops will blur the same way phones and tablets has.  

Missed Tock, the Watch-dog, from Phantom Tollbooth
&gt;+1!!!
&gt;&gt;Let&#039;s not jump to Conclusions!
&gt;&gt;&gt;Beats the Doldrums

What about the Swatch from the &#039;80&#039;s?
&gt; I have one.
&gt;&gt; Swatches are now almost as big as cars. Not quite, though.

As far as non-cellphone-watches go, I prefer mechanical ones. The main reason is that my body kills the battery on quartz watches. If I get a month out of it, I&#039;m doing fantastic! I once had a watch that started running slow, but it would run normal if I left it on the desk away from my body.
&gt; He&#039;s a freak!  Run for your lives!!!
&gt;&gt;She&#039;s a witch! BURN!
&gt;&gt; Kill it with fire!

I like the older style watches. They come in handy</textarea><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
