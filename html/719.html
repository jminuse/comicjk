&gt;Unlong as using premade parts, computers are the same or more eco-friendly
&gt; Ubuntu is by far the worst Linux distro by every conceivable measure - primarily because they do the opposite of what users actually ask for.

Well I for one can&#039;t wait for my whole browser to be web-based!... Wait a sec...
&gt;You can&#039;t write interpreted code interpreters in interpreted languages. Somewhere down the chain somewhere, something has to be native code.
&gt;&gt;I think they mean programs are based on HTML and JS, like iOS does.  Of course, the sudden, obvious and painful realization that computers and smartphones are two different classes of device is what makes this a bad idea.  I wonder when Microsoft will come across it.

Well I for one, welcome our new product overlords.

Ugh.. I hate this kind of mentality - I&#039;d like to see someone write high-performance software in HTML5.. ya know - things like Ableton Live, Video editors, high-priced industrial engineering software and the like.  Interpreted script software has it&#039;s place, but I hate the idea of widespread deployment where it just doesn&#039;t make sense.  Everything will get bigger, slower and more power hungry - it&#039;s unavoidable.  Why is native code so bad?
&gt;Who said it was?
&gt;&gt;Microsoft. Pay attention, that&#039;s the whole point of this comic!

Overlooking that Microsoft didn&#039;t actually say everything would be based on HTML5, did they... ? They made an announcement saying HTML5 would be one way of writing software in Windows 8 and showed a demo of the &quot;tablet-style&quot; interface which has been written in HTML5... and the world seems to have decided that &quot;one way&quot; meant &quot;the only way&quot;...
&gt;But they did say that it would be &quot;the way&quot;, which suggests that they think it is a good idea for applications to become apps.
&gt;&gt;But &quot;the way&quot; does not always get accepted by everyone.  A lot of games on the PS3 aren&#039;t 8-way multithreaded because it&#039;s bloody hard to program that way.  But that is how best to use the PS3.  I&#039;d wager software that requires decent performance (CAD, Rendering, GIS, Video editing, Video games...anything I missed) will stick with native code - it&#039;s the way those teams have always worked, and there are major issues with trying to do those tasks with HTML5 - a dynamic lighting simulation for shadow positions throughout the year (used in architecture for window positioning) already takes at least a day of calculation on a decent computer - some older computers being used for rendering take as long to handle a single frame.  That said, given how Excel is often used in industrial situations, and given Microsoft likely will stick to their guns, the megaspreadsheets are going to be problematic.

Shoopery doop.

LOL maaaazi... hhaahahhah
