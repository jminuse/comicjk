Why is there a gob of yellow slime on his head?

SHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWahahahahahh...
Dundundun dundundun dundundun dundundun
Doo-wah dooooooooo..., doo do doooooooo...
&gt;Ummm, wat?
&gt;&gt;Doctor whoooves!
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dubstep.

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s technically wasting time if you time travel to do it.
&gt;Another comment better than the comic. Aren&#039;t we a witty crew ;]
&gt;&gt;( at least one Superman comic in the late 1970&#039;s held the notion that a time-traveller could spend however long they wanted in a different era: on returning to &quot;their own time&quot;, they would return to the same physical age they were when they left - **yet retain their full set of memories** - which would seem to be a tad inconsistent, admittedly... )
&gt;&gt;&gt; You expect consistency from DC Comics productions?  Even Marvel has trouble with that, and they have a slightly more contigious universe.  (I&#039;m sorry, but where exactly is Gotham City?  How about Superman&#039;s city...whatever it&#039;s called, if anything.)

&gt;Can&#039;t use the sub, but could still nuke the CRAP out of stuff.  Wait is this a nuclear submarine like the 20 warheads per missile type, or just a nuclear POWERED sub that uses torpedoes?  I sense ambiguity...
&gt;&gt;well, there is the middle-ground: nuclear-powered hunter-killer subs carry Tomahawk cruise missiles with conventional warheads... some might question the aptness of a weapon called a Tomahawk in that geographical location in that era...
( Tomahawk is the transliteration of a word used by the Powhatan, who lived in the area that is modern-day Virginia... )
&gt;&gt;&gt;Judging from the scale, I&#039;d say this isn&#039;t the mobile stealth ICBM silo.  Those subs have a pretty decent sized crew, and ICBMs are pretty damned big.  I&#039;d say this&#039;d be a torpedo sub or a sub-hunting sub.

Shout out to Harry Turtledove?
&gt;Guns of the South was a good book

Shout out to Dr Who ? - in the 1965 story &quot;The Time Meddler&quot;, a rogue Time Lord plans to use &quot;ATOMIC BAZOOKAS&quot; in 1066 to destroy the incoming Viking invasion fleet, in the belief this will allow King Harold to concentrate on the Normans, and so win the Battle Of Hastings... ( The Battle Of Stamford Bridge against said Viking invasion was actually a *major*, *incredible* victory for King Harold... and would be remembered as such, if it wasn&#039;t for the unfortunate business at Hastings, shortly after... )
&gt;His reasoning was that, although that first battle was a victory, it meant his forces were depleted and tired when the Normans came around. Yes Harold&#039;s guys won, but then they didn&#039;t get time to rest.
&gt;&gt;Well that&#039;s pretty much what I said :)
but I deliberately said &quot;belief&quot; as mainstream historians point out the Saxons were winning Hastings until quite late in the battle - a lot of analysis cut too short is that they would likely have won if they had remained behind the shield wall; it wasn&#039;t a question of how fatigued the Saxons were, it was apparently more a question of discipline and maintaining control in the heat of battle...

Isn&#039;t hat guy XKCD&#039;s thing?
&gt;It&#039;s public domain xD
&gt;&gt;Dammit Randall, get out of my comicjk. Wait, on second thought... don&#039;t!
&gt;&gt;&gt;More importantly, I know I&#039;ve seen this /exact/ comic before.

Hah! I took nukes back to the Miocene!
&gt; Hah! I took nudes back to the Miocene!
&gt;&gt; Hah! I took noobs back to the Miocene!
&gt;&gt;&gt;Hah! I took doobs back to the Miocene!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hah! I took the Miocene back to around 20 million years ago!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ah, that takes me back!

Why not just install rocket launchers on raptors?
&gt;Why bother? They&#039;re incredibly deadly anyway. Just bring a squad forward in time and train them a bit, so they don&#039;t eat your own side. Far better than drones!
&gt;&gt;Have you ever TRIED to install a rocket launcher on a raptor? Not so easy, really.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Have you ever tried a raptor? They&#039;re not easy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That&#039;s what Claw Carver said too... ( good grief, I&#039;ve just realised how old that reference is: so old they didn&#039;t call it a raptor, they called it a &quot;terrible claw&quot; ) 

Is there a tense inconsistency in the first panel?  
Yep there sure is
&gt;I don&#039;t know. I haven&#039;t gave it much thought.
&gt;&gt; +1
&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#039;t you recognise the future semi-conditional modified subinverted plagal past subjunctive intentional tense?

Brilliant. The tri-civil war. With time travel. If so, I say we give the homo reptilians fusion reactors.
