Pretty cool, I took it a while back and got a range of 1450-1600, screwed up the writing though..

Forget your thoughts on number 485 here. THESE ARE NOT THE DROIDS YOU ARE LOOKING FOOOOOOR!!!
&gt;What am I doing here?
&gt;&gt; These are not the &#039;roids we are looking for!

Good luck, but you don&#039;t need it.  I took it and got 550 Math, 800 English.  If you want to hire me post your email here and I&#039;ll email you my penis :D

heh. i did that once. then i went to jail, so it did not matter

GRE is Cake! Ok, ok, the numbers part is, at least...
&gt; The GRE is a SPY!
&gt;&gt; This is news?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Not  necessarily 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mammaluigi
&gt;GRE is a lie?

Good luck buddy! Getting a DhP??

Good luck.  Don&#039;t fail!

Friday the 14th.  Nice


I bombed your mom guys.... this comic is officially the end of xkcd.
&gt;Really?
&gt;&gt;You can&#039;t see mammaluigi when you commonly visit this website? Shame.

Good luck! As a geek you are required to get 800 on alphabetical or we will all laugh at you... forever. ;) &lt;- gay smiley

Again, why can&#039;t the comic appear in the RSS feed, thus requiring less clicking and allowing for more laughing?

Yay GRE! (apparently, seeing as I don&#039;t even know what the GRE is...) - Negative Twoth
&gt;We could tell, Idiot...
&gt;Graduate Records Exam

Good luck, have fun!

I love laughing at mammaluigi trying to study for the math part. That&#039;ll teach them for not paying attention to basic algebra.
&gt;Yeah, haha, sucker.  Too busy drinking and getting laid and having fun to take the time to not suck at the portion of the test that _his_ prospective admissions commitee/employer won&#039;t care about
&gt;&gt;Guys, there&#039;s a comic about this that makes you both look like idiots. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Link or number please?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh come on, you don&#039;t remember that one?

Best of luck to me
