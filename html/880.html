Your mother supports Rick Santorum because she likes it when a man tells her what she&#039;s permitted to do with her body.

He isn&#039;t even Catholic... -_-
&gt;You don&#039;t have to be Catholic to want to be the Pope
&gt;&gt;He is a practicing Roman Catholic
&gt;&gt;&gt;He just doesn&#039;t understand Catholicism 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Let&#039;s make a &quot;Catholicism Wow&quot; campaign!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#039;m an atheist and I want to be Pope.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well I&#039;m a christian and i don&#039;t think the Pope is one. I&#039;m also ignorant.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s a limitation here.

Who is this? I&#039;m not from the US, so a wee bit unfamiliar with current states of the pre-elections...
&gt;Guy seeking the Republican nomination. Very socially-conservative.
&gt;&gt;my my what I large rock you live under.
&gt;Christian extremist. Openly opposes separation of church and state, wants to ban gay sex and all birth control, and obviously denies global warming. If you Americans elect him as president I&#039;ll buy a bunker and prepare myself for World War III (I&#039;m not joking).
&gt;&gt;I&#039;m American and if we elect him, I might buy a bunker too.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I said it when Sarah Palin was running for VP, and I&#039;ll say it now: &quot;If he&#039;s   elected, people will be hopping the border to Mexico&quot; :P
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Go for it. The people who say they&#039;ll leave if X is elected never do.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#039;ll be packing my bags, on a plane, and exercising my Norwegian citizenship
&gt;&gt;&quot;Christian extremist&quot; and &quot;denies global warming&quot; do not *obviously* go together... I for one would expect a &quot;Christian extremist&quot; to believe global warming to be the wrath of their God, incurred as a direct consequence of general acceptance of contraception or gay marriage or eBay or something...
&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah but god loves the USA.  He would obviously do something more targeted at gays like send us to war or make a big hurricane.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fine point. How about this: &quot;Right-wing-America extremist&quot;. After all extremist don&#039;t choose their opinions based on logic, they form their bias based on whatever they hear and then accept and reject things according on what they like.

&gt; You&#039;re all wrong.  Santorum is the frothy mixture composed of lube and feces that sometimes results from anal sex. To &quot;rick&quot; is to remove something with your tongue. I don&#039;t need to define the most disgusting sentence in the English language - &quot;Rick Santorum&quot;. Note to deletionists: This is not a troll - it is 100% true and easily verified.  I did not create the nasty, I&#039;m only communicating it.

When the state that elected him senator hates him, you know that&#039;s a bad sign. --Signed PA resident.
&gt;Or good, depending on which Philadelphia-encompassing &quot;keystone&quot; state it is. 
&gt;&gt;What?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Pennsylvania is Pittsburgh and Philadelphia with Alabama in between. If it wasn&#039;t for the two cities, the rednecks would vote the biggest bible-humping god fear&#039;n asshole into office every time.
Sounds just like Wasilla, Alaska; a stones throw from here.  But here a lot of far right embrace Ron Paul because he&#039;s even more radically right of common sense.
&gt;What distinguishes Ron Paul is he is the only one that recognizes codified limitations on government power.
&gt;&gt;Also, in 2008, his campaign advertised that he grew organic tomatoes. No word on whether or not that continues.
&gt;&gt;&gt;though, to be fair, if it *had* continued since 2008, those tomatoes would now be big enough to have their own post code...
