&quot;ft&quot;? Oh, my. Learn to use proper units, not that customary American crap.
&gt;Yeah. Like inches. 
&gt;&gt;Have you ever tried to write x&#039;^3?  (x cubic feet).  Unless you have really bizzare handwriting, it consistently looks like x^13.  There is a very very good reason for using ft and in instead of &#039; and &quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Or y&#039;know cm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Use SI like real scientists...

Wow, I Can Write On This Square Of Text....
Phreaky.
I am an American and though I often use imperial units – I did grow using them – I like the metric system more than imperial units, mostly because it is based on powers of ten.
&gt; point taken
&gt; What do you mean, “mostly” because of the powers of ten? What other things are there to like about the metric system that the imperial system doesn’t provide?
&gt;&gt;Decent constants?  Take the angular velocity*torque=power equation.  SI: rad/s*Nm=W.  Imp: rad/s*lbft/550.  For fluid pressure, there&#039;s a similar problem, though that&#039;s mainly due to the choice of standard units for pressure - Imperial standards tend to like water gauge or mercury gauge readings, which results in some aggravating conversion factors from psi to inches of fluid gauge.  SI tends to work in Pascals (well, kilopascals or megapascals, but those are just a factor of 1000 and 1 000 000 respectively, and if you&#039;re using SI, you&#039;d better have at least those prefixes down, plus milli and micro (thousandth and millionth).  Metric tends to work well with physics - a lot of constants used in imperial measurements become 1 in metric.  If we could come up with a metric time system that worked, and maybe use a metric standard for number of atoms rather than Avogadro&#039;s arbitrary number, then we&#039;d have a base ten system for all 7 primary dimensions.  
&gt; Surprising that hardly any IT people try to introduce a new system based on powers of 16 - I meant 0x10! ;-)
&gt;&gt; Though we aren&#039;t the most sane people when talking about units... Kilobyte/Kibibyte/Kilobit/Kibibit, anyone?

this guy takes &quot;not drawn to scale&quot;  to the next level
&gt; it actually is drawn to scale, it just requires an extra dimension or two of space than is normally assumed
&gt;&gt; if ComicJK featured Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, would they be… erm… drawn to scale ?
&gt; We have an engineering maths textbook that uses a mixture of imperial and metric units in its problems... It annoys me SO much. I&#039;m not even in the U.S. - I&#039;m in Canada, which teaches the metric system exclusively, although people still use pounds for weight and feet for human height in their everyday lives.
&gt;&gt;...why? Why not just stick to one? I&#039;d go with the one that makes more sense...
  --Because Canada used to be on the imperial system, but then a number of decades ago switched to metric for trading purposes. I suspect that with so many people having grown up on imperial, imperial stuck in some areas of life (such as a persons weight and height... as well as in most areas of construction... although I am told that some builders will use metric... but with most lumber and stuff coming in imperial measurements, I can&#039;t see that too many people would use metric for that). 
&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#039;m an engineer by trade and I don&#039;t have a good feel for how much force or how much stress is on a structure unless it&#039;s in US Customary units. I can tell you that 40ksi is a pretty high stress for steel, but I have no idea how much 100 MPa is without doing some conversions...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Conversions like &quot;1 tonnes/cm^2&quot; or &quot;100atm&quot; (both of course to 1sf)? Imagine how it feels for the those in the rest of the world who wouldn&#039;t be able to work with &quot;40ksi&quot; without first converting it into more familiar units.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I live in Canada too, and for things like people&#039;s height, almost everyone uses feet and inches. I think its easier to guesstimate, maybe? If someone gives me their height in cm, I&#039;m usually confused. Use metric for everything else, though.
Why is it bigger on the inside?
&gt;Because it&#039;s the Tardis.</textarea><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
