Yup, C++ is over-engineered (the Turing-complete template system comes to mind), but not having function overloading in C is also not practical.

Stroupstrop reckons that an ugly task should involve an ugly syntax. He was talking about type casting, but it doesn&#039;t explain the rest of the language....

The reason why people use C++ a lot is that there isn&#039;t really any better alternatives.
&gt;Exactly! I write drivers for a living. We use C and C++ and sometimes perl to autogenerate the C and C++, but there really are no alternatives.
&gt;&gt;Sure, delete the comments that don&#039;t conform to your image of the world. well done...
&gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry, it looks like they deleted your comment before my mother could grab it. Because I normally try restore comments if someone says their it had stuck to being ``C with classes&#039;&#039;. I have managed to find a subset of the language, where I mostly use the legacy C compatibility, but take advantage of C++ features. Unfortunately, the C++ standard libraries don&#039;t agree with this. ~LukeShu
&gt;&gt;&gt;Please do not use the ASCII grave accent as a left quotation mark
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There, I fixed it for him. I also fixed the ellipsis being three periods, though that&#039;s not as bad.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#039;ll have you know that the GNU coding standards specify that the backtick be used for left-quote. Additionally, using characters outside the standard ASCII set creates problems for older browsers, or special purpose browsers. For example, take the LISP comment below. The user&#039;s browser substituted in `&amp;#65533;&#039;, the HTML entity for U+FFFD (Unicode replacement character) for each non-ASCII character you put in (I&#039;ve normalized the above to ASCII). Gee, it&#039;s almost like the GNU hackers knew that non-ASCII characters would cause issues for some users. And I clearly lacked the intelligence to realize that given the nature of this platform; the fact that every time it is updated, the entire existing conversation must pass through the user&#039;s browser, making it an *ideal* location for character mutation to happen. It already happens enough on BBS system where data must only pass through 2 browsers, the poster&#039;s, and the reader&#039;s. And the effect of this certainly isn&#039;t amplified by the fact that this site is very simple, not requiring a sophisticated browser; it would be less of an issue on a site making heavy use of scripting, HTML5, or other ``web 2.0 technologies&#039;&#039; (a term I hate). There&#039;s no way that I considered all this before deciding to use the backtick for my left quote mark. ~LukeShu PS: I hadn&#039;t noticed at the time, but the encoding of this page is unspecified (in H.TTP header and document). Firefox treats it as Windows-1252 because the H.TTP header says it&#039;s running IIS. My archiver treats it as UTF-8. It&#039;s unsafe to use non-ASCII characters here.
&gt;&gt;&gt;C++ standard template libraries are powerful and all, but the text on them &quot;The C++ Standard Template Library&quot; is horrible. I try to figure out how to insert something in a set and it takes me half the afternoon to figure out that it needs a pair and then another couple of hours to find where pairs are documented, let alone how to use them.
&gt;&gt;and I&#039;ve never figured out the custom allocators and the function objects mess with my brain on 90% of the days.

My cat prefers kibble, I tried C but he segfaulted all over the carpet.

I just finished reading every comic in order. I have no life. ~BYI
&gt;I have done this at least 4 times. I have a life.
&gt;&gt;You just don&#039;t use it?
&gt;&gt;&gt;It&#039;s still in the original packaging.

Y&#039;all could use lisp and be done in 10% of the time...
&gt; I&#039;ll come back in 4000 years once you&#039;ve written an OS in lisp.

I like how this is way larger than most/any of the other comments sections.
&gt;Several go up to the 4000 character limit. 0 left
&gt;&gt; 4000? That sounds like a rather arbitrary limit.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You&#039;re an arbitrary limit. &gt;:( 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your mother&#039;s count of dorky college boys has an arbitrary limit.</textarea><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
