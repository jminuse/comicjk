Enter your thoughts on number 555 here. Please, no spamming, trolling, or TLC555s.
What?

Your mother&#039;s duty cycle on my dick outperforms a 555.

&gt;We want NE555s none of that TLC555 crap.
&gt;&gt; I prefer the 666&#039;s - 20% more!
&gt;&gt;&gt;20% more EVIL!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;20% cooler

You must All bow down to me. I am the god of the 555! If you don&#039;t believe me, I do have references who will attest to as much. Side note, What sort of duty cycle are you getting?

Hey, I&#039;m reading this at 5:55! I don&#039;t get the joke, but I thought that was oddly coincidental.
&gt;CAS Latency, I&#039;m guessing.  5-5-5-x memory is very low latency, and thus has the amazing timing referenced in the comic.
&gt;&gt;No, Google 555 Timer
&gt;&gt;&gt;It&#039;s one of the more useful ICs in my opinion.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, it&#039;s on a horrible IC. You clearly have never seen what it can do to your power rails!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; True dat! [^_^]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#039;s what decoupling capacitors are for.

Yay for being an eng undergrad

Took me a few seconds but I got it. (And I&#039;m a Mechanical engineer!)
&gt; I saw it with the first line. It helped that I made a 555 joke myself earlier today. (And I&#039;m a Chemical Engineer!) I&#039;ll have to wait another 3472 comics for an entirely epic win though.

Anyone else getting tired of all the meta-jokes about &quot;gee, that&#039;s dumb, how bad will a joke have to be to use THAT topic?&quot;
&gt;Nope.
&gt;&gt; I don&#039;t think that&#039;s dumb. I&#039;ve seen better execution though.
&gt;&gt;&gt; He can make these jokes with whatever frequency he wants. He simply might notice different resistance to the genre and a different capacity to handle it from some of the readers based on that frequency. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I see a lot of potential with that strategy.

Do they even teach engineering students about 555s anymore? They were common long before most of you were even born.
&gt;not as far as I know of, I&#039;m learning engineering right now and never heard of it, although other IC&#039;s I have, heaps funny comic though
&gt; &quot;bread and butter.&quot; Much more convenient than crystal oscillators for simple timing.
&gt; they may have been common ages ago, but they&#039;re still common now too - some things are too damn useful to fade into obscurity

555 who&#039;s a which now?  What course should I take to get this comic?

Took a while to laPlace this one...

Hehe, nice one :D DIY electronics ftw
&gt;this, I get it because of DIYing, not any courses that I&#039;ve taken at any school.
&gt;&gt;Same here. I&#039;ve never taken an electronics course in my life, but only because they don&#039;t offer any at my high school.

I GET IT. Solely because of a mediocre java-based circuit sim whose site I read about once somewhere years ago. I think I win for &quot;most obscure reason I get the joke&quot;
&gt;no, you fail.
&gt;&gt;no, YOU fail.
&gt;&gt;&gt;No, your mom fails.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, YOUR mom fails.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Your momma fails so much, she should be called Mrs. Cha.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Who is &quot;Mrs. Cha&quot; anyway?

I ACTUALLY GET IT
&gt;YEAH ME TOO! IT IS AMAZING!

Obscure?

I&#039;m *SO* not an engineer or electronics person and I didn&#039;t even need to think about this one to get it. 
I love this one!

I find it upsetting that I know /just/ enough about electronics to understand this, but trying to make a circuit involves lots of swearing and acts of random violence.</textarea><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
