^yes!

we rule!!!!!!!
&gt;All of which fall under one of the four real branches of engineering.  They&#039;re like subbranches. 

How on earth do you equate radiation with chemistry?! And what about vacuum?! A vacuum is non-chemical. Pressure is physical but does relocate to stoichiometry.
&gt;Radiation I might give you is a bit of a stretch (its more NRE turf, which doesn&#039;t really fall under ChemE), but have you never even Google Chemical Engineering? Clearly not since you seem to have zero clue what it is. 
&gt;&gt;Chemistry is not the same as chemical engineering.
&gt;&gt;&gt;A chemist deals with the reaction kinetics and such on a small lab scale. It&#039;s up to the chemical engineer (or process engineer) to scale the process from a few hundred mils to several hundred tonnes per year.

&gt;&gt;What does biomedical fall under? Chemical? &gt;&gt; it falls under electrical believe it or not. (No it doesn&#039;t) &gt;&gt;BMed actually is the bastard offspring of ChemE, ME, and biology, with some bits a pieces thrown in from EE and other stuff.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Biomed quite clearly falls under spam.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Biomedical is not engineering, period.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How about Bioengineering?
&gt;&gt;Spam, Engineering Physics, Mining Engineering, Spam, and Spam are all well outside the 4 listed.  Show me a civil who claims to have a proper understanding of high-stress rock behavior, and I&#039;ll show you someone who&#039;s lying.
&lt;&lt;&lt;Hell yeah mining!

Oh man, that alt-text applied to me. I was thinking &quot;mechanical engineering does most of those things that chemical engineering does&quot;. I guess we are all the same.
^I was thinking the same thing. 
&gt;I did that before even reading the alt-text. 
&gt;&gt;Ditto. Dang mind-reading-alt-text!
&gt;&gt;I was shortly before posting it... And I didn&#039;t read it either :D
&gt;I was just thinking along the lines of 1. I was going into the transportation aspect of Civil Engineering, and 2. This just means that Chemical engineers have to fluff their resumes more.

To err 
lal

Couldnt be more wrong, Civil Engineers deal with transportation, structural, construction, water resources, some examples design of dams, Water and Wastewater treatment plants, skyscrapers, highways, roads... basically anything infrastructure related.

Mechanical Engineers design almost everything that moves, construction equipment, elevators, planes, turbines, cars, robotic parts, missles, guns, blah blah blah people rely heavily on the safety of these things.

Electrical systems are involved closely to any of these, control systems are used in cars, planes, chemical engineering plants, infrastructure, u dont want your electrical systems failing.

Either way, engineers work together on a variety of complicated systems involving a variety of different variables. This cartoon analysis is a shallow attempt of trying to put chemical engineering at a more involved level of maintaining the safety of the public. When in fact, all the engineering professions have a complex interconnection of variables that must be considered in relation to public safety.

All engineers are at risk of obesity and carpal tunnel syndrome from working in their otherwise safe offices at their desks. They don&#039;t have any of those risks. The fatalities from those things are suffered by the hapless clients and their low-paid workers.
kkkk
I WIN
This is a cool little box!

I KNOW AWESOME BOX COMMENT SECTION.

MIKE WAS HERE

Or maybe butts are just too eccentric

Grat idea,

All your engineers are belong to us!

Something wicked this way comes.
