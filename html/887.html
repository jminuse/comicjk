Did you hear? Italy&#039;s legally elected government was replaced by a bunch of former Goldman Sachs executives. I&#039;m sure They&#039;ll have the country&#039;s best interest at heart! 

MOTHER OF CELESTIA.

But Italy didn&#039;t choose these people, the EU put them in after Burlesconi suggested that maybe, just maybe, the Euro wasn&#039;t all that good for Italy.

Yes, the problem with current &quot;governments&quot; is that they&#039;re missing the &quot;highly-educated&quot; part. Is there ANY evidence that people in governments are better prepared to run their country than the average person? How about the average Ph.D? I&#039;d really like to see it.
&gt;...what?
&gt;&gt; What what? I was posting a small rant/question mostly related to the comic. Did I mess my English up again or something?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Something just doesn&#039;t follow.  Seems like you should be asking whether there is evidence that people in government are highly-educated, or whether the highly-educated are better prepared. Unless I&#039;m missing your point? Are you asking if we&#039;ve selected effective people to govern?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;People in governments are chosen by their ability to be elected and stay in their function as long as they can. It&#039;s the dark side of (non-biological) evolution. It&#039;s kinda like IQ represents the ability to solve IQ tests, rather than intelligence. Luckily there is a strong correlation.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most people in governments are &quot;highly educated&quot; by common people&#039;s standards (i.e. they have a degree in something), but there are LOTS of people like that in a country. I guess my question was:
1. Sort all the people in a country by decreasing order of &quot;ability to successfully run the country&quot;.
2. Take 50 random politicians (group A).
3. Take 50 random PhDs in anything (group B).
4. Are the members of group A, on average, in a higher position than the members of group B?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh Ok* I get that.  Fair question.


Democracy results in an idiotic government:
news.yahoo.com/people-arent-smart-enough-democracy-flourish-scientists-185601411.html
&gt;Two things: the conclusion of that article is that democracy results in mediocrity, not idiocy; and the measure is of leadership, not intelligence.  I think we can agree we need a strong leader, &lt;no we can&#039;t!&gt; but more importantly, we need one who will lead us in the right direction.  An effective dictator bent on global conquest would not be preferable to a mediocre leader keeping the ship afloat.  Other than that though, the study was interesting. Thank you for sharing.



&gt;I&#039;d like to see representative democracy replaced by a jury from each state. They could be well paid and spend a month or two educating themselves on the relevant issues. I&#039;d throw in some kind of IQ test, but it&#039;d be ruled illegal. </textarea><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
