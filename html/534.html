I have to say, either it is quite lame, or I don&#039;t get it. It think it&#039;s the latter...
&gt;Nope. It&#039;s the former.
&gt;&gt;Guys, guys! It&#039;s a PUN.
&gt;&gt;&gt;That pun is as phunny as this one.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I still think it&#039;s the latter. I see no connection between the common theme of the cinematograph and him not beeing case-sensitiv. And I see no connection to the common meaning of the phrase &quot;case-sensitive&quot;. I think I lack some essential knowledge to get this one. Or it&#039;s really just lame.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It&#039;s applying the term &quot;case sensitive&quot; (meaning recognizing capitals and non-capitals as separate characters) to Sherlock Holmes, who isn&#039;t all that sympathetic to many of his cases.  I&#039;m not sure what the &quot;common theme of the cinematograph&quot; refers to, though.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I got that (is missing sympathy to cases), but normally there&#039;s a reference in one way or another to the original meaning, in this case that of differentiating between upper and lower case characters, but I&#039;m missing this here entirely.


Hmm... Unrelated to this comic, but I just noticed that 0 no longer seems to be the Easter egg :(
&gt;If you are referring to the Alt-Text that appears when you hover over the picture, then that has never been associated with a 0. Otherwise... enlighten us and tell us what you are talking about.
&gt;&gt;There used to be a comic id 0, which was a picture of an Easter egg with a congratulations message. Now 0 goes to the latest page instead.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I noticed that too. So sad :(
&gt;&gt;&gt;The comic is still there: comicjk.com/Pics/Comic0.gif
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The comments box is gone though...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I found it! comicjk.com/comic.php/1. (include the dot)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bets on what it&#039;s gonna be next! I bet [2]
