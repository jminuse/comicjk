&gt;of all those who claim &quot;x is guaranteed by the Constitution&quot;, how many have actually read the actual documents... ?

Don&#039;t think I get it. Are you saying that x( the level of support from all politicians) is unrelated to y(level of support from voters)?
&gt; The left-right isn&#039;t an axis.  It&#039;s just graphing voter support vs. what the politician says about it.
&gt;&gt; Shouldn&#039;t it be titled: make your words count?
&gt;Seconded i&#039;m not understanding this graph at all
&gt;&gt;You people are morons. With your vote, you can change a politicos response from &quot;Not my problem&quot; to &quot;Of course we&#039;re for that side of that issue... in fact we&#039;ve always been.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Ohhh, now i get it. Thanks.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the problem is we are all conditioned to read the vertical axis as a function of the horizontal.  This seems to be the other way around.

In my opinion this isn&#039;t a graph - graphs have more than one axis.
&gt;It does have 2, one of them is just chromatic instead of spatial.
&gt;He should have made it 1 pixel wide to make it more clear.
&gt;&gt;Or make it a graph.
&gt;&gt;Or at least not drawn both axes as labeled black lines.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Second last point.

Your mother.... nevermind - I&#039;m sick of seeing you throw tantrums and crying and deleting these.  Frankly, it&#039;s just sad for a grown man.  You know who you are.
&gt;I hate deletionists too, but frankly, I wish these &quot;your mother&quot; jokes went TOO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!!!!i¡!!!1!!?$. - and may they stay there and not bother us again
&gt;&gt; It&#039;s not like it pollutes the entire comment box with large rants.  The &quot;your mother&quot; guy tends to try to keep it to a single line near the end (it has the best impact if it&#039;s the last word).
&gt;&gt;&gt;so does your anus.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cockblock!

Awesome!

Someone deleted the funny!  Now what am I supposed to do?

It&#039;s nine-o&#039;clock on a Thur-s-day. The regular crowd shuffles in. There&#039;s an old man sitting next to me, wondering where the &lt;PROFANITY&gt; today&#039;s comic is....
&gt; The artist is busy banging your mother.
&gt;&gt; Last person obviously didn&#039;t get Piano Man reference, or would have made a better &quot;your mother&quot; joke.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Naw, we just don&#039;t like Billy Joel.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Son, can you draw me a webcomic?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, but it will only be slightly better than this one, and the result is people will only make fun of my mother and my crappy jokes, so it&#039;s not worth it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ComicJK, is that you?

&quot;States rights&quot; is how anyone protests a federal change. There were states who wanted to ban &quot;predatory lending&quot; who were overruled by the Bush admin, and so far as I&#039;m aware, rank and file Republicans didn&#039;t utter a peep. (I don&#039;t think that giving a loan secured only by the property purchased and at an unusually low rate is a predatory act. The predatory act was letting people misrepresent their income so that Countrywide could profit off the good name of the US at the expense of purchasers of MBSes)</textarea><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
