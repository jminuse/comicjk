theyï¿½re sick and tired of hearing about the health effects  of drinking pop. An additional 12% of pop drinkers say that they could do to lose some weight and cut back on their sugar intake, while the other 10% say that they&#039;d like another bottle of Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi while they contemplate suing the statistician who came up with these figures for statistical malpractice.
&gt;I&#039;m not confident in your sigfigs.
&gt;Assertion rejected for lack of sufficient significant digits.

99% of soda drinkers are tired of the other 1% calling it pop.
What&#039;s soda?
&gt; 99% of Canadian pop drinkers are tired of freaks calling it &quot;soda&quot;, because that&#039;s totally and completely inaccurate.  &quot;Soda&quot; was the fizzy BEFORE carbonation.  Modern carbonated beverages are NOT soda.
&gt;&gt; This!  When your great grandma poured powdered stuff into water in the 1930s to make it fizzy, THAT was soda.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sometimes I drink soda. I&#039;ve never seen a beverage of a type &#039;pop&#039;. I drink fizzy beverages more than I drink soda.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I drink soft drinks.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I drink Alcohol
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I drink your milkshake.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What, like water? It&#039;s non alcoholic, it&#039;s soft.

&gt;&gt; 93.3% of non-native English speakers are tired of being confused by all these silly vocabulary differences in different countries. (an olsou bai de lak ov konsistant pronaunsieixon an orthagrafi).
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6.7% of all native English speakers are tired of the same thing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And the rest are English Majors. 

This percent of pop drinkers wants actual sugar in their sodas rather than HFCS.
&gt; HFCS is actual sugar.  Maybe you mean &quot;sucrose&quot;.
&gt;&gt; Plus, sucrose and HFCS are absolutely no different health-wise.
&gt;&gt;Actually, the FDA just ruled that HFCS is NOT sugar.
&gt;&gt;&gt;HFCS is exactly that: corn syrup, a sweetener. Fructose is sugar, like glucose or sucrose.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HFCS is just glucose with some fructose added in to make it taste sweet.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It&#039;s ridiculous that people make such a fuss about HFCS because what happens to sucrose as soon as it hits your stomach acid -- it gets cleaved in half to become glucose and fructose.
&gt;I&#039;ll take the HFCS.  I&#039;ve had the &quot;throwback&quot; products that use real sugar; no thank you.
&gt;&gt;I prefer galactose-glucose combined sugars. The &#039;artificial sweetener&#039; ones not only don&#039;t taste very good to me, but cause an allergic reaction.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Where do you find that?

HFCS is not sugar - it&#039;s a sugar solution.  It has 5% more fructose than &quot;regular sugar&quot;.  &quot;Sugar&quot; is the chemical definition for any chemical within that family.  &quot;Sugar&quot; colloquially refers specifically to sucrose.  Let&#039;s keep it straight people.  Yes glucose, fructose, galactose, maltose, lactose are all sugars.  But outside of a bio/chemistry setting, &quot;sugar&quot; means sucrose.
&gt; Where are you getting this 5% number from? What makes HFCS &#039;high fructose&#039; is that regular corn syrup is just glucose, and HFCS has some fructose added in. HFCS can range from as low as a few percent of it being fructose to as high as over 90% being fructose.
&gt;&gt;I thought they generally use 55% fructose.  Maybe it&#039;s more of a guideline than a definition.  But here is one source: www.livestrong.com/article/249286-chemistry-of-high-fructose-corn-syrup/
