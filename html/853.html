It&#039;s not only English that has no bounded length...having no bounded length on sentences is a fundamental feature of human language.  Recursion and all...

In Hungarian, sentences can go on for thousands of words - indeed, in Hungarian literature there are sentences that run for many pages.

you know, sometimes words mean different things in different contexts, and sometimes there can be more than one accepted meaning;
&gt;sometimes a word which has meant something significant for centuries is turned on its head in ten years by corporate-serving internet slang;
&gt;&gt;or a word which has meant those supporting less government and more personal freedom for almost as long(Liberal) can be turned on its head in 4 years by an avowed Statist(FDR);
&gt;&gt;&gt;agreed - both are bad, because it is dishonest and misleading;  It co-opts the strong emotion attached to the prior meaning;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cf. &quot;tolerance&quot;

change those periods to semicolons;
&gt;you mean full stops.

this sentence might end one day; like, now; but then again, maybe later would be better; also, don&#039;t capitalize after a semicolon; no line breaks either;

I recognize the point you&#039;re making, and to that I say: stop the pirates AND the thieves; because to support Piracy as is commonly defined is to support thievery and affect innovation, and to support Piracy as you define is to support SOPA;
&gt; &quot;Thievery&quot; is an incorrect word too, since nothing is actually taken away; &quot;Sofware
  Piracy&quot; is a new thing, and people should stop trying to squeeze it into old crime definitions;
&gt;&gt;plagiarism, one might ask; but thats only if you attempt to pass it off as your own; no i&#039;m
  thinking thievery because of the myth of Prometheus who stealing fire from the gods
  made it available to mankind, thus allowing mankind to advance beyond the stage of
  huddling in a cave freezing; the gods still had their fire but now mankind had a
  copy as well; and just like the MPAA the gods totally overreacted in punishing him;

This is why I much prefer the term &quot;copyright infringement&quot;, as it&#039;s much, much more accurate, as it doesn&#039;t imply that it&#039;s as serious as theft.
&gt;+2 this also has the benefit of being what it actually is.
&gt;&gt; ^that

Your mother talks like a pirate - the real kind.

I hate to rain on your parade, but that was four sentences.
&gt;The first one clearly doesn&#039;t include itself. So three?
&gt;&gt;Four. “People … thieves.” “That … means.” “Pirates … mankind.” “Holding … man.”
