My dad can supply your anus&#039; demand.
&gt;Brother? Is that you?

Assuming the speculators know when there will be supply disruptions. 

With futures contracts and an excess of tankers, supply disruptions are manufactured.
&gt;How do people make money by not delivering oil? Can I get in on the not-delivery business?
&gt;&gt;Because by not delivering, they can create an artificial shortage
&gt;&gt;It&#039;s easy to get in - just buy an oil tanker.
&gt;&gt;1) Half Supply 2) Triple Price 3) ??? 4) PROFIT!
&gt;&gt;&gt;Step 3 seems unnecessary in this case.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This doesn&#039;t work. Once you try to sell the supply you were holding back, the price will fall again.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you sell half the supply at triple the price, you will get 150% of what you&#039;d get by selling the whole supply at normal price.

Does &quot;Fear of oil speculators&quot; mean that the oil speculators fear something - or that someone fears oil speculators?
&gt;At first I thought it was obviously the latter, making this a poke at the whiners.  But on further thought, it follows perfectly that it be the former.

I can&#039;t respect anyone who believes that the price of oil will go down and supply will go up in the average long term.
&gt;Of course not - I would think it would happen as it always has in the average long term, price and supply will both go up.
&gt;&gt; Oil supply cannot go up.  Oil is not magically produced - it is mined.
&gt;&gt;&gt;The world&#039;s supply cannot go up, but the supply on the market can certainly go up. Especially if it was previously driven down by a temporary disruption.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Also because there are still untapped pockets and reservoirs of oil. There is a fixed amount of oil in the world, yes, but we&#039;re still finding more. We&#039;re also accessing shale oil and other means to produce it. To suggest we&#039;ve found it all implies that we have much more info on the Earth&#039;s detailed composition than we actually do. 

&gt;try a few of these / rather than }}}}
&gt;&gt; Say what? Backslashes disappear and don&#039;t work if that&#039;s what you tried.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh I see.  If you put a double backslash, it escapes and it will display. But then it only displays 1 backslash, so the next person to post ends up implicitly removing them.
